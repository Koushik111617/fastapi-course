pip install python-jose[crytography]

    from jose import JWTError, jwt
    secret_key, algorithm(HS256), Expiration Time

   from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer


pip install passlib['bcrypt']   --- this is for hashing the password
hashing is one way, it's not like encrypt and decrypt


JWT Token:
   Header :   algo:Hs256, type: jwt
   payload: username:, userid:
   secret:

   we will pass these three things to signature algorithm, which will give us the token, this token is not encrypted.


Alembic:
pip install alembic
alembic init alembic ====> this will create directory alembic(with some files .env is one of them) and also a file (alembic.ini)
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "added phone number column"
alembic history
alembic upgrade head
alembic revision -m "Create posts table"
alembic upgrade
alembic upgrade +1 alembic downgrade {provice revision number}
alembic downgrade -1
alembic downgrade -2
alembic current    ====  this gives you the current revision number

-------------------------------
API can get requests from postman, curl, mobile devices, web browser

cors policy( origin resource sharing):
   allows requests from a web browser on one domain to a server on a different domain
if our api is hosted on google.com and our website is hosted on a ebay.com. ebay.com by default cannot send a request to an api running on
google.com which is of different domain. its gona get blocked by CORS Policy.

if our api is running on google.com and our website is also running on google.com then it will be a talk just fine by default.
to prove this :
go to browser and type localhost:8000 and hit enter you will get the response

webbrowser---inspect---console---fetch('http"//localhost:8000/').then(res=>res.json()).then(console.log)
